0.3.2
=====
- Further clean up the ExoIconView code and add several small optimization.
- Import exo-mount utility to drop the dependency on other mount utilities,
  like pmount and gnome-mount, that don't work reliably, and were often the
  cause of trouble when mounting in Thunar.
- Add optional mount notify tool, which notifies the user that a device/media
  is begin unmounted by the system and gives a hint when the device/media can
  be disconnected/removed.
- Add exo-hal library, which provides several HAL related utility functions
  that have been deprecated in libhal-storage, but are required by several
  modules.
- Import ExoMountPoint module, which provides platform independent access to
  the configured and currently active mount points. This is required by other
  modules like exo-mount and thunar-vfs (for the trash implementation).

- Detect complex mailto:-URIs properly (Bug #2530).
- Fix compilation on amd64 (Bug #2758).

0.3.1.8beta2
============
- Imported the "Xfce Preferred Applications" framework, which allows users to
  select their preferred applications (i.e. web browser, mail reader, terminal
  emulator) using a nice graphical interface, rather than having to figure out
  where to add which environment variable to make Xfce use Firefox as default
  web browser. The "Xfce Preferred Applications" framework can also pass
  additional information when composing emails using the preferred mail reader,
  for example, you can use the extended mailto:-syntax to open the composer
  with a predefined subject and automatically attached files.
- Updated the ExoIconView class to support an API compatible to the GtkIconView
  in Gtk+ 2.8, and improve the performance of the icon view.
- Added single click navigation support to ExoIconView.
- Added hover-selection support to ExoIconView in single-click mode, which
  automatically selects an item when the mouse is paused over it for a
  certain amount of time.
- Added "Right Arrow Keyboard Navigation" to ExoIconView, as suggested in
  http://chabada.sk/better-desktop/#nautilus-improvements.
- Added a compact layout mode to ExoIconView, similar to the list view found
  in Windows Explorer.
- Added a new widget ExoTreeView, which extends GtkTreeView with single click
  navigation.
- Added a new widget ExoWrapTable, which layouts its child widgets in an
  automatically wrapped table. For example, this is used for the emblem
  chooser in Thunar.
- Added a new utility exo-csource, which can generate C source code from
  arbitrary data.
- Added a new utility exo-desktop-item-edit, which is used to create new
  launchers/links on the desktop and when dropping URLs to the file manager.
- Added various new convenience functions to make dealing with strings,
  pixbufs and other data structures easier for C programmers.
- The number of relocations in the library and the number of linked dependencies
  were reduced to improve the startup time of applications using this library.
- Updated class structures to make sure constant static strings aren't
  unnecessarily duplicated at runtime, and provide other packages with
  the same functionality by exporting the functions and macros in
  question.
- Updated the python bindings to include the new functionality.
- Support three different levels of debugging support (yes/minimum/no).

0.3.0
=====
- The icon bar is now sized and rendered properly with all Gtk+ theme engines.
- The following obsolete components have been removed: ExoIce, ExoFileWatch,
  ExoUri and ExoPropertyProxy.
- A bug in ExoCellRendererEllipsizedText was fixed, which caused Xfmedia to
  crash under certain circumstances.
- The dependency on D-BUS is gone.
- Python bindings have been added.
- Updated API documentation.
- New translations: Dwayne Bailey (en_GB)


0.2.0
=====
- The ellipsizing functions now use the Pango 1.6 builtin functionality
  if available.
- Added lightweight session management support with the ExoXsessionClient
  class.
- The API of ExoEllipsizedLabel was changed to be compatible with GtkLabel
  in Gtk+ 2.5 and above.
- Added an ellipsizing cell renderer ExoCellRendererEllipsizedText, compatible
  with GtkCellRendererText in Gtk+ 2.6.
- ExoIconBar has an "orientation" property now. The "selection-changed" signal
  has been renamed to "changed". The ExoIconBar background is updated when
  the Gtk style changes.
- libexo is fully internationalized now. German translations are already
  available.
- The ExoToolbarsView class has been changed to provide a "Customize
  Toolbars..." menu item together with the other items and to emit a
  signal "customize".
- ExoPropertyProxy has been replaced by ExoBinding, which is based on
  the GObject Binding Properties implementation available from
  http://ex-code.com/glib-bind/. ExoBinding is way more powerful and
  easier to handle than ExoPropertyProxy. ExoBinding contains some
  improvements over GBinding; for example, GBinding can run into an
  endless loop, when you bind properties of type GBoxed, whereas
  ExoBinding doesn't suffer from this problem.
- The MD5 functions have been changed to be compatible with the MD5 API
  found in libegg.
- The API documentation is nearly complete now.

0.1.3
=====
- Added a framework for editable toolbars (ExoToolbarsModel, ExoToolbarsView,
  ExoToolbarsEditor and ExoToolbarsEditorDialog).
- Added initial API reference documentation.
- Added version information variables and macros similar to whats used
  in Xfce and Gtk+.


0.1.2
=====
- Fixed a style problem with the iconbar.
- Fixed a bug in the md5 module, that caused the libexo compile to fail
  on some GNU/Linux systems.
- The configure option --enable-final now enables linker optimizations for
  plattforms that support it (recent GNU binutils required).


0.1.1
=====
- An ICE module was added, based upon the ice-layer from xfce4-session and
  the gnome-ice module of libgnomeui.
- libexo no longer requires SSL on non-BSD systems, since a MD5 fallback
  implementation was added, which will be used if the system doesn't
  provide MD5_* functions.
