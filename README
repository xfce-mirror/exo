What is it?
===========

This is libexo, an extension library to Xfce, originally developed by
os-cillation. While Xfce comes with quite a few libraries that are targeted at
desktop development, libexo is targeted at application development.


Current state
=============

libexo is considered ready for production use. You do no longer need to
define the EXO_API_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE preprocessor symbol.


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.


Debugging Support
=================

libexo currently supports four different levels of debugging support, which
can be setup using the configure flag `--enable-debug' (check the output of
`configure --help'):

  `full'    This is the strongest option. Deprecation and some coding style
            checks are made and will cause the build to fail for any errors
            or warnings.

  `yes'     This is the default for Git snapshot builds. It adds all kinds
            of checks to the code, and is therefore likely to run slower.
            Use this for development of libexo and locating bugs in libexo.

  `minimum' This is the default for release builds. This is the recommended
            behavior.

  `no'      Disables all sanity checks. Don't use this unless you know
            exactly what you do.


How to report bugs?
===================

Bugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system
(https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/exo/-/issues). You will need
to create an account for yourself.

Please read the HACKING file for information on where to send changes
or bugfixes for this package.
